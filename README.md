# POLYana
Software for rheological analysis of colloidal systems.

POLYana is a software dedicated to analyze rheological data obtained from

- G' and G'' as a function of temperature and frequency;
- Viscosity as a function of temperature, frequency and shear rate and
- Shear stress as a function of shear rate.
 
The software calculates gelation temperature, adhesion and consistency values, G'/G'' ratio, viscosity from G' and G'' data, hysteresis and other rheological parameters. It uses some models commonly applied in rheology analysis, like as 

- Boltzmann model;
- Cross model;
- Herschel-Bulkley model;
- Maxwell model and
- Power-law model

# Install POLYana
- Download the fold "Polyana **";
- Unzip the fold;
- Open the unzipped fold and click on POLYana software icon - "POLYana **.exe" (it takes some time to open... be patient please!);
- Before using POLYana, click "Options" button and verify all the options. Then click "OK"; 
- All your data must be save in ".txt" extension. Pay attention on this.
